    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p><span class="fun">Bubble Under</span> is a group of family divers that formed in 1995 and we are
      happy to share our found passion with new and experienced divers alike.<br>
      My name is John Doe and I and the CEO and founder of Bubble Under. South
      Lake Tahoe is a beautiful land mark and underneath its waters is even more
      beautiful to the naked eye. Our team organizes weekly <br>
      meets with small groups on the weekends to ensure lower costs and that
      everyone has a diving buddy. </p>
    <p>Although we're based in South Lake Tahoe, we also go to monthly meetups
      to other divers across the West Coast of the United States. The ocean
      reefs are absolutely beautiful.</p>
    <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a bar and share stories.(<em>any</em>
      excuse,eh?)</p>
    <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
    <blockquote class="fun">
      <p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old
        Speckled Hen. You can quote me on that!</p>
      <p>"Join us for a weekend away at some of our favorite dive spots and
        you'll soon be making new friends.</p>
      <p>"Anyway, about time I got on with some <em>proper</em> work!"</p>
